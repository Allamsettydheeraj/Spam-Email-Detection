## Introduction
Spam emails can clutter inboxes and pose security risks. This project aims to create a model that can automatically identify spam emails, improving user experience in email management.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam). You can find more details about the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library
- **nltk**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spam-Email-Detection.git
   cd Spam-Email-Detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the Data**:
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model**:
   Execute the model training script:
   ```bash
   python src/model.py
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**:
   Use the prediction script to classify new emails:
   ```bash
   python src/predict.py
   ```

4. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   You can also explore the analysis and model training process using the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/spam_detection.ipynb
   ```

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted spam emails to the total predicted spam emails.
- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted spam emails to the actual spam emails.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The classification report will be printed after model evaluation, providing detailed insights into the model's performance.

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or transformers) for potentially better performance.
- Use more advanced techniques for text augmentation to enhance the dataset.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
